# Evaluation Instructions

## Introduction

The purpose of this excercise is to evaluate you approach to creating a very simple Node.js backend application. We expect you to spend no more than a couple of hours or less to complete this and it will be used to evaluate how you approach a technical task.

## Sequence

1. Clone this repo
2. Create a simple Node.js API that accepts an HTTP request
3. In this application make an http request to a public service that we have defined
4. Transform the response so that it meets the specification defined in the [supplied OpenAPI specification](../openapi/evaluation.yaml)
5. Ensure that your code is appriately tested
6. Publish your code to a source repository that we can access
7. Provide us with a link to this code at least a day before you come to see us.

## Evaluation Details

Using any libraries that you wish create an application that listens for
